* A Code Distribution Repository
This repository contains sample code for SUNY Potsdam's CIS 310
Operating Systems course offered in Fall 2020.

It is a collection of C++ programs. Initially the programs do not use
a =Makefile=; eventually they will be more complex and require build
tools.

** Subprojects
- ParallelArraysInC++ :: A first C++ program. Uses a single file
  application to track names paired with floating point
  numbers. Included README.org presents an "assignment"; DESIGN.org is
  the redame for the finished solution.

  Code is in the =src= subdirectory and test files (a script and data
  files) are in the =test= subdirectory.
